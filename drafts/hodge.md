Throughout this post, I'll assume familiarity with the basic notions of Hodge
theory. Here's a writeup for anyone curious. 


Let $X$ be a smooth and proper complex variety. The various cohomologies of $X$ encapsulates
important structural information of $X$ in the form of abelian groups and linear algebra.
For example, if $X$ is defined over $\Q$, the action of the absolute Galois group
$G_\Q$ on $X$ induces a representation of $G_\Q$ on the (\'{e}tale cohomology) of $X$. 
Any subvariety induces a cohomology class -- its fundamental class as a submanifold. 
A natural question is then whether we can go backwards, associating subvarieties to 
cohomology classes. If so, we could translate objects and maps from the "linearized" setting
to subvarieties and maps between them. This question is addressed by the Hodge conjecture
and the Tate conjecture.


I hope to say some more about the Hodge and Tate conjectures in a subsequent post, but for
now I wanted to post about a computation that Professors Madhav Nori and Frank Calegari
independently assigned to me as an exercise last fall. 


Let $\mathrm{Hdg}^i(X) \subset H^{2i}_{\t{sing}}(X,\Q)$ denote the \textbf{$\Q$-vector space}
of Hodge classes -- $\Q$-linear combinations of the fundamental classes of 
$i$-codimensional complex subvarieties of $X$. 

\begin{conjecture}[Hodge]

$$\mathrm{Hdg}^i(X


\end{conjecture}


\begin{question}
    What are the Hodge classes
