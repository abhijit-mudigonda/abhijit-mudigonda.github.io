I primarily work in number theory but have broad interests.
Take a look at my [CV](Mudigonda-CV.pdf) to get 
a sense of some of the things I've done.

#### Research 


##### Publications


- B. Matschke, A. S. Mudigonda. [_Quadratic Fields Admitting Elliptic Curves with Rational $j$-Invariant and Good Reduction Everywhere_][quad-egr]. Journal of Number Theory. Volume 247, June 2023, Pages 162-210
- A. S. Mudigonda, R. R. Williams. [_Time-Space Lower Bounds for Simulating Proof Systems with Quantum and Randomized Verifiers_][qma-lb]. ITCS 2021: 50:1-50:20.

##### Miscellaneous 
- A. S. Mudigonda. [_An Efficient Reduction from QMATIME[n] to the k-Local Hamiltonians Problem_](lham-tight-complete.pdf).
- D. Gutfreund, Q. Fan, A. Mudigonda. [_Restructuring Deep Neural Networks to Reduce the Number of Parameters_][patent-link]. (U.S. Patent 1166344382)

#### Expository Writing

Here are some things I wrote as an undergraduate student.  

- [Profinite Groups, Infinite Galois Theory, and an application to Kummer Theory](infgalois.pdf): Term paper for 18.704 (Seminar in Algebra), taught by Prof. Bjorn Poonen. 
- [Sphere Packing in 8 Dimensions](sphere-packing.pdf): Written for 18.786 (Number Theory II), taught by Prof. Wei Zhang, and loosely following [this][cohn-spheres] survey by Henry Cohn
- [Towards Quantum PCP: A Proof of the NLETS Theorem](quantumpcp.pdf): Written for CS 229 (Physics and Computation), taught by Prof. Boaz Barak. We also wrote a corresponding [blog post][qpcplink].  
- The official [course notes][18218-notes] to 18.218 (Combinatorics of the Grassmannian), taught by Prof. Alex Postnikov. There are a lot of edits to be made and proofs to be filled in. 
- [An Algebraic Approach to the Dirac Equation](algebraicdirac.pdf): Term paper for 8.06 (Quantum Physics III). 
- [Structure Determination of a Suzuki-Miyaura Coupling Product](536paper.pdf): Term paper for 5.36 (Biochemistry and Organic Lab).
