I was on the writing team for Mystery Hunt 2023.


The puzzle I'm most proud of is 
[To Numbers And Back Again](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/puzzlefactory.place/puzzles/to-numbers-and-back-again/),
which incorporates many different aspects of Indian culture. 


Here are some other puzzles I wrote or co-wrote:
