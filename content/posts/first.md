In the summer of 2017, I thought to myself, "I should make a website
and blog about math." I did not blog about math that summer. Frankly,
I did not do very much math that summer either (sorry Ryan). I did,
however, make the first version of this website, which at the time used
Jekyll, and wrote some snippets of code to convert my TeX files into 
MathJax-parseable markdown. Over the years, I occasionally updated 
this website, but made few substantial changes. This continued until 
sometime in early 2021, when I tried to switch from my theme at the time, 
Minima, to a new theme. Powered by a volatile combination of 
impatience and incompetence, I not only failed to change themes,
but somehow corrupted my Jekyll installation in such a way that I could not
produce any website that was not the theme's default page. 
Despite reinstalling Jekyll, starting a brand new website, and (attempting to) purge
this new theme from my system, I could not rectify the situation.

After some struggles, I gave up. Because only the local version of my website
was broken, my website remained online -- I just couldn't change it. 
This was unfortunate, because during this time, I started graduate school,
and people actually started looking at my website! 
Also since starting graduate school, I've written several half-finished expository notes.
This happens in a rather funny way. I frequently give talks at student seminars. Every time I do so, I try to choose a topic
that I don't know very much about. Because I am overambitious, I consistently 
underestimate how long it will take me to actually learn this topic. Because I usually don't mind
improvising, I have very little sense of urgency when it comes to preparing things. 
As a result, I almost never finish my notes before the talk happens. 
I also sometimes write down sketches of proofs of interesting results that I hear from Frank
or from other students, but don't always finish them. 


This summer, one of my goals is to flesh out several of the notes that I've left unfinished.
To that end, I bit the bullet, started a new website -- using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
this time instead of Jekyll, patched up my LaTeX to Markdown [script](https://github.com/abhijit-mudigonda/abhijit-mudigonda.github.io/tree/master/tex2markdown)
to work with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), and wrote my first post. (This is being written
after the Vinogradov's theorem post, oops). 


Let's see how long this lasts :)
