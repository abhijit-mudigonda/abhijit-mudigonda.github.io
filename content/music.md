#### A Cappella Arrangements

Here are some a cappella arrangements I've written or co-written. Many arrangements are mashups of an English song with an Indian-language song (most often Hindi). 
Most of these pieces were written for the [MIT Ohms][ohms-site] but I've written pieces for other groups as well. My work has been featured on Voices Only,
BOCA, and been nominated for the CARAs.

#### Miscellaneous

I was a music concentrator (i.e. minor-minor) at MIT, and had a chance to take lots of music and theatre classes, with a particular focus on composition. 

- A string quartet loosely inspired by carnātic music (classical music of South India) for 21M.310 (20th Century Composition), taught by the marvelous [Charles Shadle][shadle-site]. 
I'm not very good at carnātic music and wholly ignorant of string instruments, but it was still fun to try: [PDF](carnaticquartet.pdf)
