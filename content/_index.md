Hello! I'm Abhijit (అభిజిత్, abʱidʒit̪), a second year PhD student at the University of Chicago
studying mathematics and computer science. I'm advised by 
Professor [Frank Calegari](https://math.uchicago.edu/~fcale/)
and Professor [Janos Simon](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~simon/). 
These days I mostly think about number theory, but in the past 
I studied quantum computers,
worked on [mixed reality headsets](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-pro/), 
and did [lots](https://www.ibo-info.org/en/)
[of](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/nsb)
[not](https://nacloweb.org/)-[math](https://www.acs.org/education/students/highschool/olympiad.html)
[competitions](https://www.soinc.org/).


In my free time (and sometimes my busy time) I do various things related to music and puzzles.
I love singing and arranging a cappella music, and 
was on the [MIT Ohms](https://www.instagram.com/mitohms/?hl=en) as an undergrad.
I'm also a member of the puzzlehunting team 
[teammate](https://www.puzzles.wiki/wiki/Teammate). 


This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator,
the [Risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto) theme, and is hosted via
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 


I can be contacted by reversing ``moc.liamg@adnogidum.tijibha``. 


P.S. - In case you were wondering, the word "pravāham" means "flow"
in Sanskrit.
