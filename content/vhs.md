title: Variation of Hodge Structures 
permalink: /vhs/
---

I will be running a weekly learning seminar on variations of Hodge structures in Winter 2025.

If you are interested, add yourself to the mailing list for announcements [here](vhs-2025@lists.uchicago.edu).

## Content

Hodge structures are an abstraction of the cohomology of compact complex projective manifolds. 
They are free modules, typically over $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{\Q}$, whose base changes to 
$\mathbb{C}$ satisfies properties like Hodge decomposition and symmetry. Variations of Hodge structures
are moduli spaces of Hodge structures, and appear in many different areas of mathematics.


The aim is to cover the material in Chapters 9 and 10 of 
*Complex Geometry and Hodge Theory Vol. 1*, by Claire Voisin.


**Prerequisites:** This depends somewhat on the participants, so it's not set in stone yet.
Currently, beyond the content of the first-year courses, I plan to assume
familiarity with the basics of sheaf cohomology and the theory of complex manifolds (e.g. 
to the level of 2.1, 2.3, and 4 of Voisin). We will give a crash course of Dolbeault cohomology
and Hodge theory but it will be helpful to have seen it before.
We may very occasionally need spectral sequences but you should be able to black-box
those steps if you aren't comfortable with them. 

## Schedule

**Schedule: ** Weekly, starting week 2. Exact day/time TBD. 

Right now, it looks like Tuesday 3:30 might be a good time, but I suppose
we'll see.


I will speak by default, but if would like to speak then
please reach out and we can discuss scheduling. 


Notes will be posted here on the day of each lecture.
