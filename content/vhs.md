title: Variations of Hodge Structures - Winter 2025
permalink: /vhs/
---

I will be running a weekly learning seminar on variations of Hodge structures in Winter 2025.


If you are interested, let me know, fill out the [Schej](https://schej.it/e/Fa9aa) to help us decide
a meeting time, and add yourself to the 
[mailing list](https://lists.uchicago.edu/web/admin/vhs-2025) for announcements.


##### Content


Hodge structures are an abstraction of the cohomology of compact complex projective manifolds. 
They are free modules, typically over $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{\Q}$, whose base changes to 
$\mathbb{C}$ satisfy properties like Hodge decomposition and symmetry. Variations of Hodge structures
are moduli spaces of Hodge structures, and they in turn allow us to study families of motives/varieties/manifolds.
They appear naturally in geometry (both algebraic and complex/differential), but also connect to topics like
Shimura varieties, prismatic F-gauges, and more. 


Some concepts we hope to discuss are the Kodaira-Spencer map, Gauss-Manin connections,
Griffiths transversality, period domains, and monodromy.


We will probably start by covering Chapters 9 and 10 of 
*Complex Geometry and Hodge Theory Vol. 1*, by Claire Voisin. 


##### Prerequisites


Depends on the participants!
Currently, beyond the content of the first-year courses, I plan to assume
familiarity with sheaves and complex manifolds (e.g. 
to the level of 2.1, 2.3, 4.1, and 4.3 of Voisin). We may start with a crash course of Dolbeault cohomology
and Hodge theory but it will be helpful to have seen it before. 

##### Schedule


**Weekly, starting week 2. Exact day/time TBD.**

Right now it looks like Monday 10:30-12 will be a good time, but I'll update based on the Schej.


I will speak by default. If you would like to speak then please reach out and we can discuss scheduling,
but there's no pressure at all to do so.

##### Notes

Notes will be posted here on the day of each talk.
