title: Variations of Hodge Structures Seminar 2025
permalink: /vhs/

I will be running a weekly learning seminar on variations of Hodge structures in Winter 2025.

If you are interested, add yourself to the mailing list for announcements [here](vhs-2025@lists.uchicago.edu).

##### Content


Hodge structures are an abstraction of the cohomology of compact complex projective manifolds. 
They are free modules, typically over $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{\Q}$, whose base changes to 
$\mathbb{C}$ satisfy properties like Hodge decomposition and symmetry. Variations of Hodge structures
are moduli spaces of Hodge structures, and they allow us to study families of motives/varieties/manifolds.


Some concepts we hope to discuss are the Kodaira-Spencer map, Gauss-Manin connections,
Griffiths transversality, period domains, and monodromy.


We will probably follow Chapters 9 and 10 of 
*Complex Geometry and Hodge Theory Vol. 1*, by Claire Voisin.


##### Prerequisites


Depends on the participants!
Currently, beyond the content of the first-year courses, I plan to assume
familiarity with sheaves and complex manifolds (e.g. 
to the level of 2.1, 2.3, 4.1, and 4.3 of Voisin). We may start with a crash course of Dolbeault cohomology
and Hodge theory but it will be helpful to have seen it before. 

##### Schedule


**Weekly, starting week 2. Exact day/time TBD.**

Right now, it looks like Tuesday 3:30 might be a good time, but I'll poll those interested later.


I will speak by default. If you would like to speak then please reach out and we can discuss scheduling. 

##### Notes

Notes will be posted here on the day of each lecture.
